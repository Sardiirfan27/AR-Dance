Marker-based augmented reality experiences require a static image also referred to as a trigger photo that a person can scan using their mobile device via an augmented reality app. The mobile scan will trigger the additional content (video, animation, 3D or other) prepared in advance to appear on top of the marker. 

in the APK, I made there are 4 markers. Each marker will produce a different output.
